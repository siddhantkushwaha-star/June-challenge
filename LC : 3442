Hint
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Your task is to find the maximum difference diff = freq(a1) - freq(a2) between the frequency of characters a1 and a2 in the string such that:

a1 has an odd frequency in the string.
a2 has an even frequency in the string.
Return this maximum difference.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "aaaaabbc"

Output: 3

Explanation:

The character 'a' has an odd frequency of 5, and 'b' has an even frequency of 2.
The maximum difference is 5 - 2 = 3.
Example 2:

Input: s = "abcabcab"

Output: 1

Explanation:

The character 'a' has an odd frequency of 3, and 'c' has an even frequency of 2.
The maximum difference is 3 - 2 = 1.



Solution : 

class Solution {
    public int maxDifference(String s) {
          Map<Character, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            char c = s.charAt(i);
            freq.put(c, freq.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
        }
        int maxOdd = -1;
        int minEven = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int f : freq.values()) {
            if ((f & 1) == 1) maxOdd = Math.max(maxOdd, f);
            else minEven = Math.min(minEven, f);
        }
        if (maxOdd == -1 || minEven == Integer.MAX_VALUE) return -1;
        return maxOdd - minEven;
    }
}
